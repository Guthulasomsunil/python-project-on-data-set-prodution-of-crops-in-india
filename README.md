Crop Analysis in India
Crop Analysis in India is a Python-based data analysis project focused on exploring agricultural patterns, crop production, and related trends across different states and regions of India.

The project uses powerful data science libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to clean, analyze, visualize, and derive insights from agricultural datasets.

Key Objectives:
Analyze crop production data across Indian states.

Identify major crops grown in different regions.

Visualize patterns, trends, and comparisons between crops.

Understand seasonal impacts and yield distributions.

Technologies Used:
Python

Pandas (for data manipulation and analysis)

NumPy (for numerical operations)

Matplotlib (for basic plotting and visualizations)

Seaborn (for advanced, beautiful statistical graphics)

Highlights:
Data cleaning and preprocessing of agricultural datasets.

Generation of multiple types of plots: bar graphs, line plots, heatmaps, scatter plots, and more.

Insightful visual storytelling about the Indian agricultural sector.

Easy-to-read code and well-structured Jupyter notebooks/scripts.
